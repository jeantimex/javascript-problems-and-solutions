/**
 * Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree
 *
 * Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.
 *
 * For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two
 * subtrees of  *every node never differ by more than 1.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],
 *
 * One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:
 *
 *      0
 *     / \
 *   -3   9
 *   /   /
 * -10  5
