/**
 * Insert into a Cyclic Sorted List
 *
 * Given a node from a cyclic linked list which is sorted in ascending order, write a function to insert a value into
 * the list such that it remains a cyclic sorted list. The given node can be a reference to any single node in the list,
 * and may not be necessarily the smallest value in the cyclic list.
 *
 * If there are multiple suitable places for insertion, you may choose any place to insert the new value. After the
 * insertion, the cyclic list should remain sorted.
 *
 * If the list is empty (i.e., given node is null), you should create a new single cyclic list and return the reference
 * to that single node. Otherwise, you should return the original given node.
